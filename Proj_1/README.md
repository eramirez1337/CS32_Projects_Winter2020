Project 1 is fairly simple, with a little review of some of Carey's slides. Last quarter's Project 7 appears once again to haunt our dreams, except this time it is a lot simpler: separate the huge file into smaller header and .cpp files. In addition, you will also have to implement a new function apart from n/s/e/w/x, called 'h' that displays where exactly the vampires got hit on the grid throughout the game. It took a little while to implement this new function as you need to assign values according to the ASCII table, but is otherwise easy. A good starter project overall.
