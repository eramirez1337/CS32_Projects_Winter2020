# CS32_Projects_Winter2020
Here is a place where I will dump my assignments for CS32 with your boy Carey Nachenberg. As per usual, a disclaimer for those who have come here for help with their own CS32 projects: use this guide only if you *really* feel lost, and only then with care. Anyway, here are my projects. Enjoy!
